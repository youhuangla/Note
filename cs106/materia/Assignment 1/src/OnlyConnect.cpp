/* TODO: You will need to add your own tests into this suite of test cases. Think about the sorts
 * of inputs we tested here, and, importantly, what sorts of inputs we *didn't* test here. Some
 * general rules of testing:
 *
 *    1. Try extreme cases. What are some very large cases to check? What are some very small cases?
 *
 *    2. Be diverse. There are a lot of possible inputs out there. Make sure you have tests that account
 *       for cases that aren't just variations of one another.
 *
 *    3. Be sneaky. Don't just try standard inputs. Try weird ones that you wouldn't expect anyone to
 *       actually enter, but which are still perfectly legal.
 *
 * Happy testing!
