 web server for chrome 替代

[Alternative to "Web Server for Chrome"? \- Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69498084/alternative-to-web-server-for-chrome)

### 使用Python内置的Http server

注：下面的方法要在路径文件夹中打开终端

>   Maybe you can do the following (if you have python installed ):
>
>   1.  Open command prompt
>   2.  Type cd your_path_to_folder_in_which_file_is_located
>   3.  Type the command : `python -m http.server`
>   4.  Hit enter
>   5.  Open browser and enter localhost:8000
>   6.  Done! to cancel the server , hit CTRL+C
>
>   If you do not have python then you can install Web Server for Chrome on any other browser . Edge , firefox .Simply go into the [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en) and search the same . You should be able to add it the usual way.

>   - 现在有一个网站的源代码和文件，包括index.html、data.json两个文件和assets文件夹等，如果直接打开，网站中的视频无法正常加载字幕，我之前使用了“web server for chrome”才能看见字幕，这是什么问题？如何修复？
>
>   ChatGPT: 
>   - 这个问题可能是由于浏览器的同源策略（Same-origin policy）引起的。简单来说，同源策略是一种约定，它规定了一些Web API（比如Ajax）可以如何与创建它们的网页的源（协议，域名，端口）进行交互。这个策略的主要目的是为了保护用户的信息安全，防止恶意的网站读取其他网站的数据。
>
>   在这种情况下，你可能在尝试使用HTML5的video标签和track元素（或者其他方式）加载一个视频和它的字幕文件。当你直接打开HTML文件（通过file协议），浏览器可能会由于同源策略，阻止视频加载字幕文件，因为字幕文件可能被认为来自于一个不同的源。
>
>   使用“Web Server for Chrome”之类的本地服务器可以解决这个问题，因为它会创建一个小型的HTTP服务器，让你的文件都在同一个源（localhost）上，从而绕过同源策略的限制。这就是为什么你会发现在使用了这个工具之后，视频可以正常加载字幕。
>
>   如果你希望能够在不使用本地服务器的情况下看到字幕，那么你可能需要考虑更改视频播放和字幕加载的方法，或者将你的文件上传到一个支持HTTP的服务器上。然而，由于这个问题是由浏览器的安全策略引起的，所以你无法通过修改你的代码来"修复"这个问题。
>
>   Person: 
>   - 有没有类似“Web Server for Chrome”的浏览器插件？
>
>   ChatGPT: 
>   - 是的，有许多类似于“Web Server for Chrome”的浏览器插件和工具，可以帮助你在本地运行一个简单的HTTP服务器，从而绕过浏览器的同源策略。以下是一些示例： 
>   1. **Live Server** : 如果你正在使用Visual Studio Code作为你的代码编辑器，那么你可以使用Live Server插件。这个插件可以为你的项目创建一个本地服务器，并且会在你保存文件时自动刷新页面。 
>   2. **http-server** : 这是一个简单的命令行HTTP服务器，可以通过npm（Node.js的包管理器）进行安装。一旦安装好，你可以在命令行中使用`http-server`命令来启动服务器。 
>   3. **Python SimpleHTTPServer** : 如果你已经安装了Python，那么你可以使用Python的内置HTTP服务器。对于Python 2，你可以在命令行中输入`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`来启动服务器。对于Python 3，命令是`python3 -m http.server`。 
>   4. **Firefox Developer Edition** : Firefox开发者版内置了一个功能，允许你通过HTTP协议打开本地文件，这样你就可以绕过同源策略的限制。
>
>   请注意，这些工具的使用可能会受到你的操作系统和安装的其他软件的影响。在使用之前，你可能需要查阅相关的文档或教程，以确保它们可以在你的环境中正确运行。
>
>   Person: 
>   - python -m http.server如何改变运行的端口？
>
>   ChatGPT: 
>   - 在Python的http.server模块中，你可以通过在命令行中指定一个端口号来改变运行的端口。默认的端口是8000。如果你想改变端口，你可以在命令后面添加你想使用的端口号。例如，如果你想使用端口8080，你可以使用以下命令：
>
>   ```bash
>   python3 -m http.server 8080
>   ```
>
>   
>
>   这将会启动一个在端口8080上运行的HTTP服务器。你可以在浏览器中使用`http://localhost:8080`来访问你的服务器。
>
>   请注意，你可能需要管理员权限才能使用1024以下的端口。同时，你应确保你选择的端口没有被其他程序使用。

```powershell
PS D:\Downloads\Compressed\ylewrk.github.io\C++  v5.0.0>
python -m http.server 8887
```

## Courses

This program is organized into four courses: <u>foundations, object-oriented programming, memory management and concurrency.</u>

### foundations

In the foundations course, you'll learn about C plus plus syntax and how to <u>compile and run</u> C plus plus programs.You'll also learn about the <u>input and output</u> features of the language,as well as how to <u>declare and initialize variables</u>,structure your code using <u>conditionals and loops</u>,and organize your code using <u>functions</u>.

### object oriented-programming

In the object oriented-programming course,you'll learn how to further organize your code into <u>classes</u>,
and you'll learn how to expose <u>interfaces</u> to those classes to other users.You'll also learn how to declare certain interfaces to be <u>public</u> and certain to be <u>private</u> using access modifiers.You'll cover the core concepts of object-oriented programming generally including <u>encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism</u>,and you'll learn how to implement those features using the C plus plus programming language.You'll close this course by learning about <u>generic programming</u> and how to use C plus plus templates to make your code more generic.

### memory management

In the next course,you'll learn about memory management.

Memory is incredibly important to the C plus plus programming language.

You'll learn how to pass around both <u>references</u> and <u>pointers</u>,and you'll learn about the differences between <u>memory on the stack</u> and <u>memory allocated from the heap</u>.You'll also learn how to take advantage of <u>scope</u> and use the <u>resource acquisition</u><!--？--> is <u>initialization paradigm</u> in order to keep track of memory that's used by your program.You'll close this course by learning about <u>smart pointers</u>,which are the best way to keep track of pointers and dynamically allocated memory in modern C plus plus.

### concurrency

The final course is concurrency.

In this course, you'll learn how to organize your code using both <u>processes</u> and <u>threads</u>,and you'll learn how to <u>synchronize</u> and <u>communicate</u> between threads.In particular, you'll learn about features of the C plus plus programming language that support <u>concurrent multi-threaded programming</u> including <u>promises and futures,and mutexes, and locks</u>.



By the time you're done with all four of these courses,you will be a terrific C plus plus developer.



## Projects

This nanodegree program requires you to complete five different projects.

### route planner

The first project is the route planner project,in which you'll build a route planner to find a route between
any two points in a real city using data from the OpenStreetMap Project.

### system monitor

The second project is the system monitor project,in which you'll implement your own version of the top program that identifies variables relevant to your system and prints out information about all the different processes running on your computer.

### garbage collector

The third project is the garbage collector project,in which you'll build your own version of smart pointers,
a way to keep track of dynamically allocated memory and prevent memory leaks.

### traffic simulation

The fourth project is a traffic simulation.In this project, you'll use concurrent multi-threaded programming to organize traffic flow through a city.Each vehicle will run on its own thread,and you'll use thread synchronization and communication to help the vehicles navigate intersections,and help traffic flow smoothly through the city.

### Capstone

The final project of this nanodegree program is the Capstone project.In this project, you'll build your own C++ application using many of the different skills and techniques that you've learned as part of this nanodegree program.

## What it Takes

Completing a Udacity Nanodegree program takes perseverance and dedication, but the rewards outweigh the challenges. Throughout your Nanodegree program, you will develop and demonstrate specific skills that will serve you for a lifetime. Congratulations on taking the first step towards developing the skills you need to power your career through tech education!

The videos, text lessons, and quizzes you encounter in the classroom are optional but recommended. In order to graduate, you need to pass every project. Projects will test your ability to apply the skills and strategies you have learned in the classroom to real-world problems. They will also provide tangible outputs you can use to demonstrate your skills for current and future employers.

Projects are designed to be challenging. Many students initially struggle, but with a little grit they are able to learn from their mistakes and build their skills. Data from nearly 100,000 Udacity graduates show that commitment and persistence are the highest predictors of whether or not a student will graduate.

At some point, nearly every student will get stuck on a new concept or skill, and doubt may set in. Don’t panic. Don’t quit. Be patient, and work through the problem. Remember that you are not alone and the problem that you are encountering is likely one that many others have experienced as well. Whether you are stuck or simply looking for encouragement, you’ll find Udacity Mentors and students there to help.

## Reviews

The most important feedback you receive from mentors at Udacity will be reviews of your project submissions.

Projects are key milestones in your Nanodegree with detailed requirements and instructions, and you can submit them from the classroom for a review.

We try to return your review within 24 hours by email.

The mentor will comment on which requirements you passed or failed line-by-line, and provide personalized suggestions for improvement or resources for further learning.

You may re-submit the project until you pass all requirements.

Students tell us they find project reviews from experts to be the most helpful component of their learning.

Udacity mentors work hard to help you improve - with a 4.9 average rating for over 2k projects a day.
