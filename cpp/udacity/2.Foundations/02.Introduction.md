# Introduction

## C++

C++ is a compiled high performance programming language.

It's particularly important for applications that have to run really close to hardware like robots or automobiles.

C++ has a reputation perhaps unfairly earned for being a complex programming language that's difficult to master.It is true that C++ is a broad language with many different features.

In this program, you're going to learn the most modern and elegant features of C++ so that you can write code that is both easy to develop and runs extremely fast.

## What C++ Is

C++ is a programming language, and there's of course lots and lots of those.

C++ is a language that is used for the foundational parts of just about anything we do.It's the stuff that sticks in-between <u>the higher level software and the hardware</u>,and that's a much bigger part of the world than most people think.

So, we're having our picture taken with a camera.There's software in that,it's almost certainly C++.As a recording equipment will quite often have C++ in it.So will the amplification and such that you use to replay this,and C++ started out in the telecommunications industry.So of course, it's all over the phones and the transmission of television and inside your cell phone and all of these places.If you look at other programming languages,they tend to be implemented in C++.So if you use Java or JavaScript,they're running on a piece that's C++ skipping running and so it's basically everywhere.I was sad to see that the Opportunity Rover just died this week and it had C++ in it because well,it was doing photography, recording,communications and also the autonomous driving subsystem or C++.So yeah, it's fun.



## C++ History

Bjarne Stroustrup created C++ in 1979 when he was only 29 years old.He was working at Bell Labs and needed a programming language to help him maintain clusters of Unix servers.

### C with classes

He wanted a programming language with both the <u>high level features</u> of languages like Simula and
the <u>raw speed of C</u>. So he created a language that he called <u>C with classes</u>.

C with classes had features like classes and also strong types but maintain the lightning fast speed of the C programming language.

### C++

C++ as he later renamed it took off and eventually was adopted by the International Standards Organization which created an <u>ISO standard</u> governing the C++ programming language.
That means that C++ is not controlled by any one person but rather by a standards body that meets regularly to map out the future of the C++ programming language.

### C++ 11

In 2011, the C++ Standards Committee released C++11 which was a major update to the programming language standard.

C++11 turned C++ into a truly modern programming language that has both the <u>elegance and ease of</u>
<u>development</u> that we associate with modern programming languages while maintaining the <u>raw performance</u> that C++ has always had.

Bjarne Stroustrup remains involved in the C++ programming language to this day as a member of the ISO standards committee,and he'll be teaching you throughout this program about the different facilities of the C++ programming language.

## C++ Today

Today, C++ is one of the most important programming languages in the world.

Millions of C++ developers use C++ to develop on embedded systems,the Internet of Things,automobiles, and high-performance servers.

Even after 40 years,the user base of C++ continues to grow as more software developers find different applications for the C++ programming language.

##  Modern C++

When people talk about Modern C++,they're often referring to the <u>C++ 11</u> release,which introduced a whole range of new features into the programming language.

Move semantics, variadic templates,initializer lists, the auto keyword,lambda expressions, null pointer,constant expression, range-based four loops, and smart pointers,all came into the C++ programming language as part of C++ 11 and changed the language dramatically.

<u>C++ 14</u> was a relatively minor release,and C++ 17 was a major release,although not as big as the C++ 11 release.

<u>C++ 17</u> includes standard file system within the standard library,standard string view, parallel implementations of many of the standard library algorithms, and inline variables.

<u>C++ 20</u> is scheduled as a minor release but will contain concepts which are an important tool for improving generic programming with templates in C++.

## Benefits Of C++

### Why Learn C++

It's really useful. 

That is,there's so many things that are programmed in C++,and there's best programs in C++.Your camera's probably programmed in C++.Your cell phones have C++ on it.There's the new data,science stuff has C++,your self-driving cars have C++.There is C++ on Mars,in the Mars Rovers.It's all over the place.

Doesn't really matter much what you're interested in.There will be a job for writing C++ in that field.It's a language with a lot of features.So you can use it to learn the fundamentals of quite a few variations of programming.

So you can learn how to work with <u>data structures</u>.You can learn how to write <u>algorithms</u>.You can write very high level <u>generic</u> code in it.You can fiddle with the bits of the <u>hardware</u> in it.

A lot of languages are built to do one thing,or they protect you against some of the unpleasantness of the <u>real world</u>,to the point where you can't actually learn how to deal with.

So C++ can be very useful as a learning tool to learn how to program.Then of course what you learned you can use.

### What Is Different About C++

C++ differs from most modern programming languages by working directly on the hardware and working very efficiently with the hardware.Then having done that,it provides really strong abstraction mechanisms that are very powerful, very modern.So that you don't have to deal with the low-level stuff all the time and you can still be efficient.

##  C++ In Industry

###  Where Is C++ Used

As a person, I like to see C plus plus being used in interesting places like your camera there,
the vast Roe was, telescopes.I work in the finance industry just now.A lot of networking is done in C plus plus.

In the games industry,most of the graphics and the animation kind of stuff is in C plus plus.So is most of the animation in Hollywood,by the way had forgotten about that.

We mentioned cars, there's a lot of C plus plus in cars.Bmw's C plus plus sharpened,had one of their cars,it's C plus plus that controls it.They use the controls.In these days the self-driving cars a lot of that work is in C plus plus too.We are talking about energy.

The iron industry uses it and the wind turbines are using it a lot.

I was at one Denmark many years ago teaching C plus plus,that some of the people have built the biggest wind turbines in the world.

So one of the things I found really cool about C plus plus is,whatever you're interested in,it's a very good way of getting in and talking to people doing these interesting things and in interesting places.

I guess a lot of the things such as more mundane,but interesting things are the unusual things is what you've been told about.The smart watches, the smartphone,or things like that.

### Why Are Industries Using C++

So why is C++ the choice,and even more becoming the choice in a lot of important fields?

We can look at embedded systems,we can look at gaming,we can look at finance,we can look at the self-driving cars,flights controls, and things like that.

The fundamental reason is this ability to <u>work well with hardware</u>,and <u>the ability to handle complexity through abstraction</u> because the programs are getting bigger these days,and you need to handle the complexity,as well as performance.

## How To Learn C++ 

### What Is The Best Strategy To Learn C++

I think first you need an <u>overview</u> of the language.

A lot of students dig in and want to know everything about some little detail.But the point is, <u>they can't understand it until they have a broader view of the language.</u>

As people go in and they see, oh, pointers.Great, I want to know everything about pointers,and why would you want to do that?

They should be work together with classes and other data types,and how do you do a traversal or a container and such.

You <u>shouldn't obsess about one little thing</u>,or they go in and they say, well,there's 32 different basic arithmetic types.It's probably right. I can't remember.I mean, that's just the sew of little type or rules for conversion.

Most of the time, I don't use all of those types,and most of the time, I don't have to think about those things.So i<u>nstead of digging into the little details,pointers, how to do a class, hierarchy,things like that, get an overview.</u>

### What Should Students Focus On When Learnign C++

I think first of all,they should try and <u>look at C++ as a modern language</u>.

Far too many have learned C++ as if it was just C or as if it was still 1985,and that pains me a lot because it's much better these days.

You look at it and you see how to use the abstraction mechanisms,you use the <u>libraries</u>.

They are the <u>standard library</u> which is fundamental data structures,few algorithms, timing, regular expressions, that kind of stuff.

Then there are <u>specific libraries</u> for specific areas, the database interfaces,you have specific graphic libraries,animation libraries, and such.

So I think when you start programming,you stick to the fundamentals for a while because,well, the fundamentals are the fundamentals.

You have to know your algorithms,you have to know your data structures,you have to know a little bit of machine architecture if you want to write at that level.

Then, you're going to actually do something.If you're writing video game,you have to know what game's engine and the libraries that go in there.So you go through the fundamentals and then something specific to your interest.

## Core Guidelines

### What Is The Orgin Of The C++ Core Guidelines

> One of the things I'm working on now as an open-source project together with people from a variety of companies all over the world.
>
> It is something called the core guidelines,which is a set of rules,that among other things says,"These are the places where you're not strongly typed,where you can get yourself into trouble."
>
> We're going to leak some buffer overflows and all the other good stuff.However, we know where they are,and we provide you with tools that can guarantee you don't do it.
>
> B.J

The [C++ Core Guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines) are a set of best practices, recommendations, and rules for coding in C++ which have been developed by Bjarne Stroustrup and hundreds of other experts in the field. These guidelines are an important part of the language, as they help users to write the best, most up-to-date C++ possible. In the next couple of videos, Bjarne will talk about the origin of the guidelines and give some advice on how to use them.

### How Should Programmers Use Core Guidelines

C++ is the tool and the core guidelines is the beginnings of a rule book about how to use it well.

It was a project, I started it, and I found other people were having the same kind of idea that you can't just
give people a power tool like that without telling them how to do it, use it.So I joined up with some friends of mine that works at Microsoft and some at Facebook now,and some Googlers have contributed,some people from CERN has contributed.If you go to GitHub,you can find that there are lots and lots of contributors,and even more gives us ideas when we talk.

Basically, it's an attempt to say what's good programming.How can we can what a good programmer knows about modern C++.

So the way it's organized is first, there's introduction,about 25 pages or so of basically philosophy because you can't give specific rules that are coherent without some notion of what's the overall aims,
what's the overall design,what are the rules of the game in general.

So if people want to start to use the core guidelines,read the first pages about philosophy and such and take from what it is.It's philosophy.But then comes the real rules,which says this is a way you can use a for loop.This is a way you can organize your error handling.This is what you have to be careful when you write concurrent code and there are several hundred rules of that sort,and pick some, and read them and see if they make sense to you.See if they're applicable to your code base and the way you do things.

This is what we do now.But that's not the way it's designed.What we've really, really want is a static analyzer that runs over your code,and then tells you, this piece of code breaks rule number C33.This thing here look at rule F13.With a bit of luck, you can click on that message,and it will drop you into the core guidelines,
and all the core guidelines are organized like this here.

#### core guidelines' organise

First, there is the number and what it's called,which is a descriptive title,then there's a rationale,
usually one to three lines short,then an example, and then anything else you want to know.
So for the more interesting rules,there'll be several examples,and there will be notes and reminders and things like that.But the way we want to get to is that you don't actually go and read the rules,you fire them up on your tool,and it'll tell you what to read.A beginning of that can be found now in Microsoft Visual Studio.Microsoft guys wasn't works on that.That's probably the best one just now.It ships with every Visual Studio.You may have to install it, but it's there,and there's a bit coming in the Klang-Tidy has some of the rules too.So we're working on it.

## Standard Library

> "The C++ Standard Library is a collection of classes and functions, which are written in the core language and part of the C++ ISO Standard itself." [*Wikipedia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Standard_Library)

Learning how to use the Standard Library is an important part of becoming a proficient C++ software engineer. In almost all cases, it is preferable to utilize functionality that already exists in the Standard Library, instead of implementing functionality from scratch. This is both because using the Standard Library is faster (it is [well-documented](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/)) and because many expert software engineers have worked on the Standard Library. The performance of Standard Library facilities is <u>optimized, robust, and almost always as fast or faster</u> than an initial re-implementation of the same functionality.

In fact, guideline [SL.1](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#sl1--use-libraries-wherever-possible) of the [C++ Core Guidelines](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines) is:

> **Use libraries wherever possible**
>
> *Reason* Save time. <u>Don’t re-invent the wheel</u>. Don’t replicate the work of others. Benefit from other people’s work when they make improvements. Help other people when you make improvements.

And guideline [SL.2](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#sl2-prefer-the-standard-library-to-other-libraries) is:

> **Prefer the standard library to other libraries**
>
> *Reason* More people know the standard library. It is more likely to be stable, well-maintained, and widely available than your own code or most other libraries.

We use Standard Library features throughout the program, since proficiency with the Standard Library is a critical for C++ developers.

### Namespace

Standard Library functions and classes exist in the `std::` namespace. [`std::vector`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/), for example, refers to the `vector` class within the Standard Library. Typically, in order to use a Standard Library feature we must both include the necessary header file (e.g. `#include <vector>`) and also namespace the class with `std::` (e.g. `std::vector`).

## Compilers

C++ is a compiled programming language, which means that programmers use a program to compile their human-readable source code into machine-readable [object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_file) and [executable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable) files. The program that performs this task is called a [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler).

C++ does not have an "official" compiler. Instead, there are [many different compilers](http://www.stroustrup.com/compilers.html) that a programmer can use.

### GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)

In this program we primarily use the [GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/), which is a popular, open-source, cross-platform compiler from the larger [GNU Project](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.en.html). In particular, we use the [`g++`](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Invoking-G_002b_002b.html) program, which is a command line executable that compiles C++ source code and automatically [links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker_(computing)) the [C++ Standard Library](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/).

### Linking

![C++ Compilation Process (Wikimedia)](img/c-compilation-process.svg)

C++ Compilation Process (Wikimedia)

In order to use classes and functions from the [C++ Standard Library](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/), the compiler must have access to a compiled version of the standard library, stored in object files. Most compiler implementations, including GCC, include those object files as part of the installation process. In order to use the Standard Library facilities, the compiler must ["link"](http://127.0.0.1:8887/C++  v5.0.0/Part 01-Module 01-Lesson 02_Introduction to C++/(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker_(computing)) the standard library object files to the object files created from the programmer's source code.

Once the compiler links together the necessary object files, it is able to generate a standalone executable file that can run on the operating system.

## Build Tools

[Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/index.html#Top) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/) are two separate and similar [build tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_automation) that both serve to help simplify the process of [building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_build) software.

In particular, build tools automate the process of compiling multiple source code files into object files, linking those object files together, and generating an executable. Build tools also often automate the process of determining which files have changed since the last build and thus need to be recompiled.

![C++ Build Process](img/c-compilation-process-16514584567432.svg)

C++ Build Process

### Make

[GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/index.html#Top) is a widely-used build tool that relies on `Makefile`s to automate the process of building a project.

A `Makefile` typically includes one or more "targets". Each target performs a different action.

`build` is a common target name that is configured in the `Makefile` to compile all of the project's source code into an executable file. `clean`, on the other hand, is a common target to delete all object files and other artifacts of the build process, resulting in a clean, unbuilt project state.

Running either `make build` or `make clean` (or any other target) on the command line would cause Make to search for a local Makefile, search for a matching target within that Makefile, and then execute the target.

### CMake

[CMake](https://cmake.org/) is a built tool that facilitates cross-platform builds, so that it is straightforward to build the same source code on Linux, macOS, Windows, or any other operating system. CMake relies on a CMakeLists.txt file, which configures appropriate cross-platform targets.

Building a `CMakeLists.txt` file can be a bit daunting, but CMake provides a helpful [tutorial](https://cmake.org/cmake-tutorial/).

In this Nanodegree program, you will not need to build your own `Makefile`s or `CMakeLists.txt` files. We provide the appropriate configuration files for each project and instruct you as to their usage.
