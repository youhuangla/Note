>   In the introduction to object oriented programming,
>   you'll learn about classes,
>   which are the fundamental building blocks of object-oriented programming in C++.
>   Classes evolved from a related type called structures or structs.
>   So you'll learn what distinguishes classes from structs.
>   The introductory lesson will conclude with two of

>   object oriented programming, encapsulation and abstraction.
>   You'll learn what these concepts mean and you'll practice implementing them in C++.
>   When we move to the advanced lesson,
>   we'll start with two more important object oriented concepts,
>   inheritance and polymorphism.
>   Polymorphism in particular can be implemented in several different ways
>   and you'll build multiple approaches like overriding and overloading.
>   We'll conclude with exercises on templates in generic programming,
>   which help make your code reusable in many different contexts.

>   - 这门课程包含三个主要部分： 
>   1. 面向对象编程导论：你将学习 C++ 中面向对象编程的基础知识。课程将介绍类（classes），它们是 C++ 中面向对象编程的基本构建模块。类源自一种相关的类型叫做结构体（structures 或 structs）。因此，你将学习类与结构体的区别。导论课程将以两个最重要的理论概念——封装（encapsulation）和抽象（abstraction）的讲解结束。你将了解这些概念的含义，并在 C++ 中实践它们的实现。 
>   2. 高级面向对象编程：在这一部分，我们将介绍两个更重要的面向对象编程概念——继承（inheritance）和多态（polymorphism）。尤其是多态可以以多种不同的方式实现，你将学习多种方法，如重写（overriding）和重载（overloading）。最后，我们将进行关于模板（templates）和泛型编程（generic programming）的练习，这有助于使你的代码在许多不同的上下文中可重用。如果不必重复自己的代码，那是非常好的选择。 
>   3. 课程最终项目准备：课程最后将为你准备一个项目，这将是对所学内容的实际应用。在这个项目中，你将运用你在面向对象编程方面学到的知识。
>
>   我们即将一起学到很多知识。

>   - 翻译"""Why did I create C++?
>   I needed a language like it and it didn't exist.
>   I was trying to build a system which might very well become the first Unix clusters,
>   something like that, and for that I needed to manipulate hardware,
>   I needed to do memory managers, process schedulers, networking,
>   interfaces and such and then I needed to abstract up,
>   so that you can say this bit runs over here and that
>   bits run over there and they communicate in this way.
>   What's a bit? You have to define it,
>   that's where the classes come in and they communicate in some way,
>   you can't just poke at memory.
>   You have to have a protocol and they have to follow it, that's another class.
>   So that's where it came from and I looked at what languages was available at
>   the time and C was
>   a good candidate for a really great language for dealing with low level stuff,
>   hadn't been as popular as it became later,
>   but anyway the support was great in hours on
>   the same corridor as Brian Kernighan and Dennis Richie.
>   The other language that could handle the top stuff was similar,
>   could handle the abstraction,
>   the only problem was it was far far too slow.
>   Far far as many tens of times too slow and so I
>   took the class concept from Simula put it into C and the rest is history as they say.

>   - 为什么我创建了C++？
>   我需要一种像它这样的语言，而它并不存在。
>   我当时正试图构建一个可能成为第一个Unix集群的系统，
>   类似这样的东西，为此我需要操作硬件，
>   我需要做内存管理器、进程调度器、网络接口等等，
>   然后我需要进行抽象，这样你就可以说这一部分运行在这里，
>   那一部分运行在那里，它们以某种方式进行通信。
>   什么是位？你必须定义它，
>   这就是类的作用，它们以某种方式进行通信，
>   你不能只是随意访问内存。
>   你必须有一个协议，它们必须遵守它，这就是另一个类。
>   所以它的起源就在于此，当时我看了一下有哪些语言可用，
>   C是一个非常适合处理底层事务的语言，
>   虽然它当时还没有像后来那样流行，
>   但它的支持非常好，就在同一走廊上，与Brian Kernighan和Dennis Ritchie一起。
>   另一种可以处理高级事务的语言类似，
>   可以处理抽象，唯一的问题是它太慢了。
>   比慢了许多倍，所以我将类的概念从Simula引入了C语言，而后就成了历史，就像人们常说的那样。

>   - Ermine为这门课程设计了一个非常棒的最终项目。
>   你将开发一个Linux的进程管理器，特别是一个名为Htop的程序的版本。
>   你的程序与Htop类似，将读取并发布关于系统上所有进程的数据。
>   你将使用C++从文件中读取数据并存储到对象中，
>   操作这些对象，并将数据输出到终端。
>   通过构建这个程序，你将能够运用本课程中学到的各种不同主题。
>   你将开发类来读取和存储数据，
>   为对象建立抽象和封装的接口以便彼此交互。
>   一些类之间存在关联，这为建立继承层次和多态的类方法提供了机会。
>   你甚至可以构建通用模板来处理多种类型的数据结构。
>   一旦你完成，这将是一个相当令人印象深刻的程序，
>   也是一个很好的项目可以添加到你的作品集中。
